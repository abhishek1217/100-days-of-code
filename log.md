# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100DaysOFCode. Gonna start coding everyday for an hour.

**Thoughts:** I will make sure I stick to this plan, and make some progress in my journey of learning programming.

### Day 1: August 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Python, learnt how to print, take inputs from user, strings, commenting, variables, different errors.

**Thoughts**: Finally started my 100DaysOFCode journey, will make sure I don't stop. Feels good to keep a log like this.

### Day 2: August 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about data types in python, how to calculate BMI, round function in python, f strings and format, and finally wrote a program that can split bill and calculate tip.

**Thoughts**: Didn't stop learning Python, didn't take a break, which is a good sign, gotta keep up this good work. Work on more projects, and keep learning every single day.

### Day 3: August 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I coded for almost 2 and half hours, it involved basic control statements, but a tough logic implementation was also a part, so it was fun coming up with the solutions. Learnt how important indentation is in Python, learnt a lot about leap years, count(), lower(), there's a website to copy paste readymade ASCII animations which can really come in handy, and learnt how easy it is to compare strings in Python.

**Thoughts**: I had severe headache, but I didn't wanna put a break to this 100DaysOfCode Challenge that I have taken up, so I started coding, soon I was enjoying it and the headache just went away. I may not be as good as other programmers, but I do have some sort of inclination towards coding, and I shouldnt doubt myself too much. Just stick to the task in hand, finish this 100daysofcode course and make progress.
