# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Came across 100DaysOFCode. Gonna start coding everyday for an hour.

**Thoughts:** I will make sure I stick to this plan, and make some progress in my journey of learning programming.

### Day 1: August 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Python, learnt how to print, take inputs from user, strings, commenting, variables, different errors.

**Thoughts**: Finally started my 100DaysOFCode journey, will make sure I don't stop. Feels good to keep a log like this.

### Day 2: August 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about data types in python, how to calculate BMI, round function in python, f strings and format, and finally wrote a program that can split bill and calculate tip.

**Thoughts**: Didn't stop learning Python, didn't take a break, which is a good sign, gotta keep up this good work. Work on more projects, and keep learning every single day.

### Day 3: August 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I coded for almost 2 and half hours, it involved basic control statements, but it had tough logic implementations, so it was fun coming up with the solutions. Learnt how important indentation is in Python, learnt a lot about leap years, count(), lower(), there's a website to copy paste readymade ASCII animations which can really come in handy, and learnt how easy it is to compare strings in Python.

**Thoughts**: I had severe headache, but I didn't wanna put a break to this 100DaysOfCode Challenge that I have taken up, so I started coding, soon I was enjoying it and the headache just went away. I may not be as good as other programmers, but I do have some sort of inclination towards coding, and I shouldnt doubt myself too much. Just stick to the task in hand, finish this 100daysofcode course and make progress. 

### Day 4: August 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about lists and round module in Python, learnt how strings can be made into a list of different types, coded a rock paper scissors game.

**Thoughts**: There's no need to memorise everything in Python, just read through the documentation of the module you are using, and just remember what that module is capable of. Don't rush into start coding a given problem, write the soution in a paper, come up with all possible test cases and then start coding the program.

### Day 5: August 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt a lot about loops, for loop to be specific, learnt more about the range funtion, learnt how to convert a list to a string by using a for loop, today's project was Password Generator.

**Thoughts**: After coding the easy part of Password Generator, I came up with a solution for the hard part, but thought to myself that there may be another method to solve it. I kept thinking about it, but then in the end it turned out that the solution I came up with at first, was the appropriate one and there wasn't another way to do it. So stop thinking that solution is wrong, if you have got the right output, then you have done it right. You gotta think of ways to optimise the code, not change the whole code.

### Day 6,7: September 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt  functions, more about loops, modules, and much more. Always wanted to make a Hangman project, and got it done today.

**Thoughts**: Could have completed a minimum of 20 days of code by now, but like always, I got lazy and didnt continue to watch daily lessons. I will make sure I will never repeat this again and complete this udemy lesson by December 20th.
